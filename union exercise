--SubQueries
--A query inside another statement(query, insert, update, delete)
--A subquery is a full query that can be executed and tested on it's own
--Can usually be used anywhere a value is used
--a subquery can often be used instead of ajoin, BUT, joins are faster

--The subquery executes first, and the results of that subquery are used by the outer statement

--join--Select all the staff names that are a 'Dean'
Select firstname,lastname from staff
inner join position on position.PositionID=staff.PositionID
where PositionDescription = 'Dean'

--as a subquery
Select firstname,lastname from staff
where positionid = (Select PositionID from position where PositionDescription='Dean')

--join-- Select the studentid and names of students that have made payments
select distinct student.studentid,firstname,lastname from student
inner join payment on student.StudentID=payment.StudentID

--A subquery
Select studentid,firstname,lastname from student
where studentid =(Select studentid from payment)
--does not work because the subquery returns more than one value
--If the subquery returns more than one value you must us IN
Select studentid,firstname,lastname from student
where studentid in (Select studentid from payment)


--studentid,names of students that have made NO payments
--join
select student.studentid,firstname,lastname from student
left outer join payment on student.StudentID=payment.StudentID
where paymentid is NULL
--subquery
Select studentid,firstname,lastname from student
where studentid not in (Select studentid from payment)
select* from student
select* from payment  


--How many payments has each(and every) student made? Show the studentid, name and the count
Select student.studentid,firstname,lastname,count(*)'Count'
from student
left outer join payment on student.StudentID=payment.StudentID
group by student.StudentID,firstname,lastname
--Returns counts of 1 when there should be counts of 0
--because the outer join returns the students that have no payments and they get counted as 1
Select student.studentid,firstname,lastname,count(PaymentID)'Count'
from student
left outer join payment on student.StudentID=payment.StudentID
group by student.StudentID,firstname,lastname
--when using count() with outer  join you must count the PK of thechild table
--If the parent has no child records it will be null and therefore not counted.
